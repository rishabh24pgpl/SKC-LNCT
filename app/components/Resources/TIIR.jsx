                    <p className='text-[12px]'> NIT Rourkela, with its intellectual capital, the human resource, the library, the laboratories and equipment, and its tradition of scholarship, is an ocean of knowledge that is waiting to be tapped by the engineers and entrepreneurs in industry for creation of wealth and welfare of humanity. The interface between the institute and the industry, the interface between the ocean of knowledge and the continents of application is the Centre for Technology Innovation and Industry Relations, TIIR for short, the Sanskrit word for the shore of a large body of water. TIIR is aimed at providing a forum to promote and facilitate activities in a manner that will not only take NIT research to Industry and Society, but also will bring the knowledge and experience of the Industry to enrich the academic programmes of the Institute.

                    <h4 className='text-red-900 text-[20px] font-bold'>TIIR: A New Paradigm</h4>
                    <p className='text-[12px]'>An institution of higher learning in the field of technology is distinguished from similarly placed institutions in liberal studies – science, commerce, arts and social sciences, as well as from engineering colleges that impart essential skills in engineering profession and shop flow management. NITs, like IITs and other technical universities, are seats of learning and innovation, some of which must be directed towards development of products and processes that contribute directly to creation of wealth and wellbeing of the society. This objective is best achieved by close collaboration with industry, government departments and comparable organizations including hospitals, municipalities and philanthropic institutions.

                        While many universities in the world, particularly those in North America, Europe and Pacific–RIM countries are strongly linked to industry, those in India have largely remained insulated from it. This situation has led not only to extreme poverty and backwardness of our people but also to loss of entire generations of valuable human resource. This trend needs to be reversed; and the time to do it is NOW.

                        NIT, Rourkela is all set to contribute a small part to nation building by bringing its faculty and students closer to industry. It aims at creating an environment where hundreds of professors and thousands of students will be carrying out research on subjects directly relevant to and funded by industry. The establishment of the Centre for Technology Innovation and Industry Relations (TIIR) is an effort in that direction
