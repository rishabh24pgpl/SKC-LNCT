                Our Training and Placement Cell not only onboards companies for
                campus placements but also strives to bridge the gap between the
                institute and industry through various initiatives. We organize
                regular workshops, seminars, and expert sessions to help
                students stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
                practices. Our team also works closely with industry experts to
                develop and update our curriculum to ensure that it meets the
                evolving needs of the industry. Furthermore, we provide students
                with opportunities for internships, live projects, and
                industrial visits, which help them gain practical experience and
                prepare them for their future careers. These initiatives have
                yielded measurable outcomes, as evidenced by our students&apos; high
                placement rates and successful careers after graduation.
