              Compute Nodes with total computing capacity of approximately 2
              TeraFLOPS performance. All nodes have 64GB of RAM. All nodes are
              interconnected with High Speed infiniband switches by Mellanox and
              Gigabit Ethernet Switches. The system uses Gluster parallel File
              system.
